They are characteristic for their strong bond to the clan. You will never see an Orc alone.</p>

                        <p>Blinded by the sun and devoted to their highest divinity Braenwyn, goddess of light and heir to the world, the Elves of light are proud and brave warriors who shine in their shining armor. Althought their greatest disadvantages by nature are their arrogance and lack of vision, they have other enhanced senses that balance the scales in any face-to-face battle. They defend the light at all costs and see as a rival anyone who does not follow their devotion to Braenwyn.</p>

                        <p>Rebels by nature, erratic and impulsive. The night elves dwell in the shadows and worship Night as a deity itself. Their dream of utopia is in a world without sun or light. They are often conflictive even with their own species. Although large societies of night elves are known, it is normal to see them alone or in very small groups. You are never safe from a night elf, they are found in every dark corner or even in your own shadow.</p>

                        <p>Fed up by what seemed like an endless ethnic war between light and darkness, this society of elves composed of both sides, night and light, opted for freedom and established their own rules as a society in the deepest forests beyond the world that sorrounded them. After hundreds of years living in the forest, they became one with it. They turned into morphologies totally distinctive to their origins and a much deeper and spiritual connection with nature.</p>

Masters of arcane arts and keepers of forgotten knowledge, they observe the world from afar, hidden from the prying eyes of outsiders.</p>
